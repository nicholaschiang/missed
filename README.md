# `missed`

This repository contains the code required to automate the management of missed connections Instagram accounts (e.g. @usc.missedconnections, @cwrumissedconnections, @byumissedconnections).
Eventually, I may consider building this as an entirely separate social media app (an app where people can anonymously share missed connections and get notified about the connections that may apply to them).
